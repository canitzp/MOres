# **MOres**

MOres is a mod for Rock Bottom, a game early in development by my good friend Ellpeck.
Look at the release section for compiled mod files.
To setup your dev env, just clone this repo, import the build.gradle file into your ide and run genIntelliJRuns for IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse doesn't work properly anyway.
Now create a folder called 'gamedata' and put the game-dev file into it. Reimport / Synchronise your gradle project and you should be able to run it inside of a dev env.


Currently this mod only adds iron ore with it's corresponding items and recipes, but I want to add a lot more and later maybe my own ore processing machines.

Have fun
